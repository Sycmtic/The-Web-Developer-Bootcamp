* Pipes 
The pipe symbol "|" is used to direct the output of one command to the input of another.
e.g. ls /etc|sort|tail–n5
get the ls of /etc directory, output to sort, after sorting output to "tail" command to print last 5 lines

The redirection directives, ">" and ">>" can be used on the output of most commands to direct their output to a file.
e.g. head -n 10 some_file > new_file
redirects the output of the head command (detailed above) to a file "new_file"
e.g. head -n 10 some_file >> exist_file
redirects the output of the head command to the end of "exist_file"

Command substitution uses the output of one command as an input to another command, it's invoked by enclosing a command as $(command).
e.g. cat $(head -n1 some_file)
this will read the first line from "some_file" and use it as the filename argument to the cat tool, which will print the contents.

if you add file name after the node operator command line can execute this file as JS

2. npm install package_name
install npm package like faker and cat-me
