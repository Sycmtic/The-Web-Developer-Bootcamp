note: 
- use "*" to define every other routes that we did not define, usually used to set error page
- use ":" to define a pattern
- req object contains all the information about the incoming request, 
  ex: "req.params" contains all of route parameters and their corresponding values which can use to get subroute
      "req.body" contains all the post request information(express do not create it, so we need to use body-parser)
      "req.query" contains all the get request information from a form(request api)
      "object._id" is the id that mongoDB automatically create for their item
      "req.params.id" is used to get the id("/:id" pattern in show route url) of object which makes request
      
Restful Routes:
name     url                verb     desc.
